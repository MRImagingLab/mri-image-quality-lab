# MRI Image Quality Slider Lab

This repository hosts an interactive, browser-based teaching tool for **medical image processing and MRI physics**.

The app allows students to explore how key image quality dimensions and common MRI artifacts affect image appearance using simple, intuitive sliders.

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This tool is designed **solely for teaching and demonstration**, including use in:

- **Medical Image Processing**
- MRI physics and reconstruction courses
- Self-study and visualization of MRI artifacts

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This is a simplified educational simulation.  
It is **not intended for clinical use or quantitative MRI analysis**.

## 🧠 Features

### Image Quality Dimensions
- **Resolution** – simulated using spatial-domain blur
- **SNR** – noise added in k-space (magnitude display)
- **Contrast** – phantom-based contrast scaling or display gamma

### MRI Artifacts
- Gibbs ringing
- Motion ghosting
- Aliasing (wrap-around)
- bSSFP banding
- Shading (B1 / coil sensitivity)
- Partial volume effects
- Spiking artifacts

Each artifact includes a brief **teaching explanation**.
